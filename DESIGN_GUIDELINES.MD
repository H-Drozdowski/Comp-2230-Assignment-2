# Design Guidelines

## Color Pallet 

Alabaster Grey = EAEAEA
Lavender = E4E1F4
vintage lavender = 827099
Dusk Blue = 3A4869
Light lavender = ada6d5
Very light lavender = E4E1F4

Black for text and borders so it contrasts enough for 
accessability.

## Font

Ill be using Oswald for the font from google fonts.
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Oswald:wght@200..700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

## Layout

I want my website to display all content of the resume cleanly
with boxes organized in a single vertical column. I want the
header and footer of the website to match aesthetically.
