# Reflection

## Can I explain what my code does?

Describe the functionality of your code and its components. How do your code segments work together to meet the project's objectives?
What was my coding process?

Layout:
For this assignment I have all of the contents of the body of my resume held within a single div set to the "container-1" class.
Inside of the "container-1" class I set it to be a flex-box that displays in a column, I also set some of the visuals. I then 
made four classes titled "box-1" - "Box-4" , with visuals set to them all. I then wrapped all the sections (about me, experience, skills, Projects) inside of div tags set each to the corresponding box class. This made all of the boxes display bellow each other in a column.
I wanted the skills and experience boxes to display next to each other but under about me, so I put them both inside their own div. I 
then made a new class called "row-container". I set the div to be the "row-container" class and in my css file set the "row-container"
class to display the flex boxes in a row so they both display beside each other. Thats how I achieved the layout of my resume. 

responsive design:
I designed my website to display well on desktop so when I tested mobile it caused some visual bugs. To fix this I used a media query.
I made it so if the devices width is less than 600 some elements are changed. Text size is increased to be easier to read on mobile.
The flexboxes displayed in a row are set to display in a column so they fit the mobile website. Some extra padding is added and some 
images size is increased to improve readability.

styling:
- Header & Footer: Created the header-footer class to customize the header and footer so they would match aesthetically.
- text: Set the font to oswald for all elements in the body tag & increased the text size.

## What was my coding process?

Reflect on your approach from planning to execution. How did you organize your work, and what strategies did you employ?
What challenges did I have?

My coding process was to first set up the framework for the layout the website then customize the aesthetics of it after.
Because I did it this way it helped me implement the correct layouts I wanted for each area of the code without having to 
worry about aesthetic changes causing issues. Since I did it this way I ended up doing the steps of the assignment out of 
order. Things like the font were completed much later in the assignment. 

## What Challenges did I have?

Identify and describe any obstacles you encountered while working on this project. How did you address or overcome these challenges?
What would I do differently now?

I had a lot of trouble understanding the flexboxes. To fix my lack of understanding I watched the videos in learn to get learn what
I was confused about. Things like how the flex boxes were displayed and how the contents of them were displayed were causing me 
trouble.

A lot of my challenges from this assignment came from a lack of understanding. Things like the responsive design and media queries 
were very confusing to me at first, because of this I went and read up on media queries. Now I think I have a good understanding of 
responsive design and media queries. 

## What would I do differently now?

Given what you have learned through this project, what changes would you make to your approach or your code if you were to start over?

I think I would study everything I didn't know prior to the assignment. If I learned things before I wouldn't run into as much trouble
and confusion when implementing the code. For the next assignment if I don't understand something from the lab Ill make sure to study it
until I understand it for the assignment.
